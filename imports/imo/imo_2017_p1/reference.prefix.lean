# IMO 2017 Problem 1 — recurrence core

For `x > 1`, the recurrence is

    next(x) = √x       if x is a perfect square,
              x + 3    otherwise.

Instead of depending on a particular API for `Nat.sqrt`,
we encode one transition relationally.

This makes the proof stable across Mathlib versions.
