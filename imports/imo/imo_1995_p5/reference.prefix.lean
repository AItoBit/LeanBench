# IMO 1995, Problem 5

Let `ABCDEF` be a convex hexagon with `AB = BC = CD` and `DE = EF = FA`, such that
`∠BCD = ∠EFA = π/3`.  Suppose `G` and `H` are points in the interior of the hexagon such
that `∠AGB = ∠DHE = 2π/3`.  Prove that `AG + GB + GH + DH + HE ≥ CF`.

The plane is modelled by `ℂ`, distances are the usual `dist`, and angles are
`EuclideanGeometry.angle`.

The proof follows the classical solution.  The hypotheses `AB = BC = CD` and `∠BCD = π/3`
force the triangle `BCD` to be equilateral, and similarly for `EFA`; moreover `B` and `E`
are then both equidistant from `A` and `D`, so that `BE` is the perpendicular bisector
of `AD`.  Erecting equilateral triangles `AIB` and `DJE` outwards, Ptolemy's inequality
gives `GI ≤ GA + GB` and `HJ ≤ HD + HE`, while the perpendicularity gives `IJ = CF`; the
triangle inequality `IJ ≤ IG + GH + HJ` finishes the proof.
