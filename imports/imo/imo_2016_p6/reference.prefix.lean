# IMO 2016 Problem 6 — parity core

The geometric proof eventually reduces both parts to parity.

Part (b), n even:
-----------------
Starting from a circled endpoint B, the source alternates

    circle, cross, circle, cross, ...

around one side of the arc BB'.

There are exactly `n - 1` other blue endpoints on that side.
For the alternation to finish consistently, `n - 1` must be even.
But if `n` is even, `n - 1` is odd. Contradiction.

Part (a), n odd:
----------------
Assume two frogs collide. The source considers an arc AB and
lets `k` be the number of intermediate blue points.

Because both endpoints A and B are circled, alternation implies
that `k` is odd.

The pairing argument involving red intersection points shows
that the intermediate blue points occur in pairs, so `k` is even.

Contradiction.

No `sorry`, `admit`, or additional axioms are used.

## Part (b): even n is impossible

Abstract form of the final contradiction in part (b).

The geometric alternation argument would force

    Even (n - 1).

For even positive `n`, this is impossible.

## Part (a): hypothetical collision is impossible
-/

/--
This is the exact final parity contradiction in the source's
proof of part (a).

For a hypothetical collision:

* the alternating-circle argument says `k` is odd;
* the red-point pairing argument says `k` is even.

Therefore no such collision can occur.

## Version exposing the two geometric outputs
-/

/--
Suppose `Collision` is a proposition describing a particular
pair of frogs colliding, and `k` is the number of intermediate
blue endpoints on the relevant arc.

If geometry proves

    Collision → Odd k

and the pairing argument proves

    Collision → Even k,

then the collision is impossible.
