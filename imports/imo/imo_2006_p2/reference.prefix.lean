The abstract counting lemma underlying IMO 2006 Problem 2.

`Special` is the type of isosceles triangles having two good sides.

For each special triangle, the supplied solution assigns two boundary
sides.  If no boundary side is assigned twice, this gives an injection

`Special × Fin 2 → Fin 2006`.

Therefore there are at most `1003` special triangles.

A formulation closer to the wording of the supplied proof.

For each special triangle `t`, choose two boundary sides
`first t` and `second t`.

The hypotheses say:

* the two sides selected for one triangle differ;
* first sides of different triangles differ;
* second sides of different triangles differ;
* a first side is never a second side belonging to another triangle.

These conditions imply that all `2 * #Special` assigned sides are
different, so there are at most `1003` special triangles.

The numerical heart of the result:
if two distinct resources are required for each object and only
2006 resources are available, there can be at most 1003 objects.
