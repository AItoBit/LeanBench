/-- The descent step, stated over `ℤ`: if `a ≥ b ≥ 0` and `a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = k * (a * b + 1)`,
then `k` is a square.  The induction is on a natural number bounding `a + b`. -/

/-- **IMO 1988, Problem 6.**  If `a` and `b` are positive integers with `a * b + 1` dividing
`a ^ 2 + b ^ 2`, then the quotient `(a ^ 2 + b ^ 2) / (a * b + 1)` is a perfect square.

The positivity hypotheses `ha`, `hb` are part of the problem statement; the descent argument
actually works for all natural numbers `a`, `b`. -/
