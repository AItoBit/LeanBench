# IMO 1974, Problem 4

Consider decompositions of an `8 × 8` chessboard into `p` non-overlapping rectangles subject to
the following conditions:

* (i) each rectangle has as many white squares as black squares;
* (ii) if `a i` is the number of white squares in the `i`-th rectangle, then
  `a 1 < a 2 < ⋯ < a p`.

Find the maximum value of `p` for which such a decomposition is possible.  For this value of `p`,
determine all possible sequences `a 1, a 2, …, a p`.

The answer is `p = 7`, and the possible sequences are

`1,2,3,4,5,7,10`,  `1,2,3,4,5,8,9`,  `1,2,3,4,6,7,9`,  `1,2,3,5,6,7,8`.
