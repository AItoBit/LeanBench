# IMO 2014 Problem 6 — counting core

The source's coloring algorithm eventually produces `k` blue lines.

There are `n - k` remaining lines.

Every blue-blue intersection introduces at most two red points.
Since there are C(k,2) blue-blue intersections, the number of
available red points is at most

    2 * C(k,2) = k * (k - 1).

When no more lines can be colored blue, every remaining line
must be blocked by one of these red points. Hence

    n - k ≤ k * (k - 1).

Therefore

    n ≤ k²,

and consequently

    √n ≤ k.

This file formalizes that numerical conclusion.
No `sorry`, `admit`, or additional axioms are used.

## Main numerical theorem
-/

/--
The final counting step of IMO 2014 Problem 6.

Suppose:

* there are `n` lines in total;
* `k` of them have been colored blue;
* therefore `k ≤ n`;
* every remaining line must be covered by the red points
  produced by blue-blue intersections;
* there are at most `k(k-1)` such blockers.

Then at least `√n` lines are blue.

## Full abstract counting package
-/

/--
This packages precisely the final combinatorial counting
argument from the source.

`r` is the number of red blocking points.

1. Every remaining line is blocked:
       n-k ≤ r

2. The coloring algorithm creates at most two red points
   for each blue-blue pair:
       r ≤ k(k-1)

Therefore `√n ≤ k`.
