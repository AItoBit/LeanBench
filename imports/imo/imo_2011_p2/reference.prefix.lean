## Discrete windmill model
-/

/--
`HalfTurnWindmill N` packages the discrete information needed from
the geometric windmill process.

* `pivot t` is the pivot at step `t`.
* `color t p` is the side-color of point `p` at step `t`.
* `period` is the number of transitions representing one half-turn.
* `color_change_pivot` says a color change can only occur at an
  old/new pivot.
* `half_turn_flip` says every color is reversed after one half-turn.

## Discrete sequence lemmas

/--
If a sequence does not change at any adjacent step from `m`
through `m+d`, then the endpoint values are equal.

If two values of a sequence at indices `m<n` are different,
there must be an adjacent change somewhere between them.

## Every half-turn contains the point as pivot

/--
A point must occur as a pivot during every half-turn interval.

If the interval starts at time `s`, there is some pivot index
`t` between `s` and `s + period` involving `p`.
