# IMO 2016 Problem 4 — arithmetic core and b = 6 construction

Let

    P(n) = n^2 + n + 1.

A block of length `b` starting after `a` is fragrant when
for every `i = 1,...,b`, there is a different `j = 1,...,b`
such that `P(a+i)` and `P(a+j)` have a common prime factor.

The source proves that the least possible `b` is 6.

This file formalizes:

* the key polynomial difference identity;
* the key quadratic identity used to restrict common primes;
* the explicit fragrant block of length 6:
      P(196),...,P(201).

No `sorry`, `admit`, or extra axioms are used.

If a number divides both `P(x)` and `P(x+y)`,
then it divides their difference.

## Fragrant blocks

/--
`FragrantBlock a b` means that the `b` numbers

    P(a+1), ..., P(a+b)

form a fragrant set in the sense of the problem.

For each index `i`, another index `j ≠ i` must exist
such that the corresponding two values have a common
prime divisor.

The block

    P(196), P(197), ..., P(201)

is fragrant.

Thus `b = 6` is attainable.
