# IMO 2019 Problem 3 — termination / graph-reduction core

The source solution uses the following structure.

1. The initial friendship graph is connected.
2. Every legal event decreases the number of edges.
3. While the graph contains a cycle, one can perform an event
   that preserves connectedness.
4. When no cycles remain, the graph is a tree/forest.
5. In a forest, whenever some vertex has degree at least two,
   another legal event can be performed and the result is still
   a forest.
6. Since every event decreases the number of edges, both
   procedures terminate.
7. The final forest has maximum degree at most one.

This file formalizes that complete descent argument.

The local graph-theoretic existence statements in steps 3
and 5 are explicit hypotheses. This avoids pretending that
Mathlib automatically supplies the synthetic graph surgery
used in the olympiad solution.

No `sorry`, `admit`, or extra axioms are used.

2. Generic decreasing algorithm
============================================================
-/

/--
Suppose

* `μ s` is a natural-number measure;
* every `Step` strictly decreases `μ`;
* `Inv` is an invariant we want to preserve;
* whenever the goal has not yet been reached, an invariant-
  preserving next step exists.

Then, starting from an invariant state, after finitely many
steps we reach an invariant state satisfying `Goal`.

This is the termination principle used twice in the source.

3. Phase I: eliminate all cycles
============================================================
-/

/--
Abstract form of the first algorithm in the supplied solution.

While a connected graph still contains a cycle, choose one
of the events described in the proof. The local graph lemma
says this preserves connectedness.

Since every event decreases the number of edges, eventually
we reach a connected acyclic graph.

4. Phase II: reduce the forest to degree ≤ 1
============================================================
-/

/--
Abstract form of the second algorithm.

When the graph is a forest and some vertex has degree at
least two, the source applies an event at such a vertex.

The local graph lemma says the new graph is again a forest.

Again, edge count strictly decreases, so this process
terminates at a forest in which every vertex has degree at
most one.

/--
This is the complete algorithmic core of IMO 2019 P3.

Starting with a connected graph:

1. eliminate cycles while preserving connectedness;
2. from the resulting forest, keep applying events until
   every vertex has degree at most one.

The resulting graph is reachable from the original graph by
a finite sequence of legal events.

users remain.

This is the pigeonhole inequality behind the source's
connectivity observation.
