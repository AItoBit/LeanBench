Suppose `crossed i` is the number of required bichromatic arcs
crossed by the `i`-th line.

If

* each line crosses at most two required arcs;

then at least 2013 lines are necessary.

If `2013` is sufficient and every sufficient number is at least

`Sufficient` is left abstract because the Euclidean definition of a
good line arrangement is not encoded in this counting-only file.
